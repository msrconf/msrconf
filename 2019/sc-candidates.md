## <a name="Bezemer"></a>Cor-Paul Bezemer

Candidate statement:
> While my first MSR was only in 2016, I have been active in the empirical software engineering community since ESEC-FSE in 2009. I have extensive experience with conducting software repository mining studies, most of which were published together with my students in journals (e.g., in 14 papers in Springer’s Empirical Software Engineering journal and 3 papers in IEEE’s Transactions on Software Engineering journal since 2016). I am also a member of the program committee of MSR since 2018. 
> 
> The MSR community has shaped my way of thinking about empirical software engineering and greatly contributed to my academic career. I would consider it an honour to contribute back to this community by serving as a member of the MSR steering committee. During my service, I would focus on how to further improve the reviewing process at MSR. While this process has already undergone several important improvements, I plan to leverage my experience with reviewing for conferences and journals within but also outside the empirical software engineering community (e.g., I am also active in the performance engineering community) to continue to improve the reviewing process at MSR. For example, I am a strong supporter of the planned initiative for MSR 2020 to provide authors with early feedback on their studies’ methodologies. I will leverage my experience with mentoring more than 15 grad students during the design and execution of their empirical studies to help design and structure this early feedback process.
> 
> In addition, recently MSR has taken the first important steps towards mining performance and operational data repositories (e.g., through TravisTorrent). I will leverage my experience in the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) research group on DevOps Performance, and in the performance engineering community, to further build bridges between the MSR, DevOps and performance engineering communities.

## <a name="Khomh"></a>Foutse Khomh 

Candidate statement:
> I started my research career in the MSR community as a PhD student ten years ago. Since then I have been an active member of the MSR community; regularly serving on different Program Committees. As a young researcher in Software Engineering, being welcomed in the MSR community and receiving mentoring, support, and advice from many senior researchers in the community was determinant in my decision to pursue a career in academia and research. If elected to the steering committee I will work tirelessly to make sure that our rapidly growing community continues to be such an inclusive, diverse, and supportive environment for young researchers. I will initiate and support every effort towards lowering conference registration fees for students and postdoctoral researchers, to allow for an even larger participation of junior researchers to MSR. I will work to help increase the involvement of industry and the open source community in MSR, to ensure that our research works continue to have an important impact on the practice of software engineering. I believe that MSR should go beyond its repositories roots and be more inclusive of all AI/ML efforts across SE. Through the activities of my Research chair on Software Quality Assurance for Machine Learning Applications, I have spearheaded the creation of a community for SE research on AI/ML based systems. I wish to continue this effort within the MSR community. My experience conducting research in collaboration with industry and open source organizations, and my background in organizing conferences (general chair for ICPC, program chair for ICPC, SCAM, PROMISE, and ICSME, and steering committee member for SANER, ICPC (chair), and ICSME) provides me with the necessary experience for these tasks. I am excited at the potential of being part of, and would be honoured to serve on, the MSR steering committee.

## <a name="Panichella"></a>Sebastiano Panichella 

Candidate statement:
> **Industry Impact/visibility:** the MSR community is a very vibrant, active, creative research community. Many interesting/novel techniques have been proposed in the last decade, to support development activities. However, many of these MSR tools rarely got the industry visibility and impact they deserve. This year we also observed high growth in the number of talks, with limited space for discussion. My goal is to foster/create an MSR industry-oriented track (e.g., collocated with close-related SE venues), where researchers can actually present their MSR-tools and meet with industry participants. Industry keynotes, presentations, tutorials, and panels will be used as the main industry-research communication channels. Finally, My goal is to extend the current call for papers (e.g., of the MSR data-showcase)  to integrate works that made a significant effort to transfer their MSR tools in the industry.
> 
> **Ph.D. onboarding:** I had the pleasure to join one of the Shonan meetings. Participating in these meetings is a pretty unique opportunity to get feedback on initial ideas, and get involved in potential collaborations with more senior/experienced researchers worldwide. Such opportunities usually do not involve Ph.D. students, and my goal is to make similar Ph.D. research meetings happen. This could help them get concrete feedback on their ideas, meeting at the same time other peers and/or more experienced researchers (which could potentially act as co-advisor for their thesis).
> 
> **Encourage (evaluation) diversity:** ensure "diversity" in the research topics and participation is a key aspect for the future of the MSR community. My goal is to ensure that artifacts, tools, and papers are evaluated by a diversified set of PC members from both industry and the research communities (to foster the impact of research outcomes), where gender diversity is a complementary/relevant ingredient of the selection process (to ensure diversity in ideas and perspectives).

## <a name="Ray"></a>Baishakhi Ray 

Candidate statement:
> MSR is at the forefront of the big data revolution in Software Engineering. It has impacted Software Engineering research starting from recommendation systems, text analytics, GitHub analytics, socio-technical analysis, ML4SE, and many more. In a way, empirical software engineering research led by MSR has revolutionized the way we look at Software Engineering research, and the impact can be seen in the number of papers appeared in ICSE, FSE, and ASE --- a majority of them are now related to empirical software engineering.
> 
> I am very fortunate to consider myself an integral member of MSR community. I have regularly published in MSR from my student days. I also served as PC of MSR multiple times. Thus, I will consider myself truly fortunate if I can serve this community and make contributions to shape its future directions. My career has been hugely influenced by MSR Vision 2020 that was held in Kingston in 2012. It was very inspiring to attend several panels summarizing the big picture and predicting future MSR research trends. I think MSR should conduct such sessions where the senior researchers of the field can have more focused and close interactions with the upcoming young researchers from a diverse background.
> 
> I also think Software Analytics can have far more impact beyond the academic Software Engineering community. If elected, I will try to improve the visibility of the conference among the broader audience by including more people from industries, and other related fields like security, machine learning, etc. Given that big code is becoming very relevant with a large number of related papers published in ICLR, ACL, etc., it is essential to include researchers from those communities to increase our visibility. Thus, I envision a bright future of MSR harnessing more interdisciplinary culture that will help Empirical Research to reach its pinnacle.

## <a name="Xia"></a>Xin Xia

Candidate statement:
> I have been raised in the MSR community and I wish to contribute to the future development of our community. My first paper was accepted in MSR 2013 when I was a Ph.D. student. After that, much of my research is inspired by papers in the MSR conference. I have already served on the MSR PC for three years, and I am very proud to have a FOSS impact paper award in MSR 2018. 
>  
> If elected, I will improve our community in the followings ways:
>  
> - Promote MSR in the Asia-Pacific region. MSR is a hot research topic in SE. However, there are not many MSR researchers in the Asia-Pacific region. I will try to attract more MSR researchers in this region, considering that a large number of SE papers are from countries like China, Singapore, and Australia recently. 
> - Improve the diversity of our MSR community. Here, diversity means not only gender diversity but also regional diversity. Most of our steering committee members are from North America and Europe, people from other regions might have different voices, which can help improve the health of our community. 
> - Increase the visibility of MSR in the Asia-Pacific region. MSR is still a Rank C conference in China. And many Chinese researchers hesitate to submit their top work to MSR due to its low ranking in China. I will continue to promote to the China Computer Federation (CCF) the increase of the ranking of MSR (actually I tried doing so last year but failed).
> - Organize MSR Asia School. This year, we will organize the first MSR Asia Winter School in November at Zhejiang University, China. I will work on making the MSR Asia School as a regular yearly school in Asia, to train more students on the latest MSR research best practices and methodologies.
